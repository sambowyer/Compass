In this portofolio we will discuss how the `R`-to-`C++` gains obtained in regular `Rcpp` can be improved upon further by parallelisation with `RcppParallel`. In particular, we'll look into `parallelFor` and `parallelReduce`, using examples based on \cite{jj_allaire_parallel_2014} and \cite{jj_allaire_computing_2014} respectively.

## parallelFor
With `RcppParallel`, the `parallelFor` loop works by **************

### Jensen-Shannon Distance

## parallelReduce
As discussed in Portfolio 7 on Intel TBB, another very useful function that can easily be parallelised is `reduce`, which is implemented in `RcppParallel` as `parallelReduce`. 
This works by ***************

### Inner Product
